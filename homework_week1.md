# Homework for the first week of virtual classes due to the COVID-19 virus

## Watch the videos

1. 2.02 Logic Programming with Prolog: Concatenate Lists (New 4K version!).
   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCMRoDsAf0w
   
2. 2.04 Logic Programming with Prolog: Invert a list (New 4K version!)

## Implement the exercises corresponding to videos 1 and 2.

## Answer the following questions:

1. Would it be possible using the concatenated predicate to get any pair of consecutive numbers from a list? If so,
How would you have to use the concatenated predicate to get it?

2. Is it possible to make a reversible use of the invert predicate? If not possible, could you justify why?

3. It would be able to indicate which characteristic makes a predicate not reversible.

4. As we have seen in class, the reversible use of predicates is a very powerful feature of Prolog. Make use
   of a combination of the concatenate and invert predicates in which this technique is used.
   
Answer these questions by creating a new file in your GitHub repository for the Knowledge Representation subject and share the repository with user jcarpio.
